### (Just A Dumb Idea)

JADI is a 3D game engine built from scratch by two university students.  
That’s it. That’s the project.

If anything breaks, it’s not our fault. Always blame the user.

## Short Description

JADI is a 3D game engine developed in C++ from the ground up by two university students.
It implements core systems such as:

 * Custom 3D rendering pipeline without external graphics libraries
 * Basic physics simulation tailored for game objects
 * Input handling for real-time interaction and camera control

This project serves as a practical exercise in understanding and building the fundamental components of a game engine, including graphics rendering, physics calculations, and input management.
